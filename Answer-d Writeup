Answer d)

I having already made such robot will do the following.
For hardware, I will use a Raspberry pi along with LIDAR and Rpi Camera Module 3 Ultrawide for high resolution navidation for reading roadsigns and avoiding people.
I will also add GPS module like Ublok Neo6m wil accuracy of 10meters.
I will add arduino to control low level electronics along with motor, motor driver, encoder(to know how far it travelled).
I will also add more ultrasonic sensors for locations that cant be covered using lidars.
At last I will add a Lipo battery which will be lightweight unlike Li-ion cause more mass will make it difficult to balance.

For software.
I am learning ROS2 to have just started so it will be difficult to use that. Hence I will not be using ROS although it is the best solution for the application given.
First I will make a PID controller loop running on arduino or more powerful controller like stm32 which will always maintain the balance of the robot.
Then I will add ultrasonic sensors as last resort if something is not detected by Lidar in order to avoide collision.
Above that will be running LIDAR on raspberry pi or my person favorite NVIDIA Orion. It really can run anything using those CUDA cores.
Then I will be running openCV for things like lane detection, high level obstetrical detection and road sign recognition.
It will run pathnavigation program like SLAM(simaltaneous localisation and mapping) along with GPS for reaching its desired location.
It will also have an interrupt attached to emergency stop button which will stop all the loops except for the balancing PID loop.

The writ-up is highly inspired from Ascento robot.
Else, it does not have any refrences, as I told, I have made the robot myself therefore I do not need any refrence. =)
